Student Grade Tracker
Develop a program that allows a teacher to enter
students' grades and compute their average,
highest, and lowest scores. You can use arrays or
ArrayLists to store the student data

STEPS TO IMPLEMENTING THE STUDENT GRADE TRACKER :-

1. Choose a Programming Language
For this example, I'll explain the approach using Java as it's commonly used for such tasks. The program will:

Allow a teacher to input students' grades.
Calculate the average, highest, and lowest scores.

2. Plan the Structure
Input: The teacher will input the grades for each student.
Storage: Grades will be stored in an array or ArrayList (for flexible size).
Processing: You will calculate:
Average Score
Highest Score
Lowest Score
Output: Display the average, highest, and lowest scores.

4. Basic Steps
Here is the plan:

Ask the teacher how many students’ grades they want to input.
Input each grade into an array or ArrayList.
Calculate the average, highest, and lowest scores.
Display the results.

5. Explanation of Code
ArrayList<Integer> grades: This is used to store the grades for each student. You can dynamically add elements to it.
for loop: Loops through the grades to sum them and find the highest and lowest values.
sum / numberOfStudents: This calculates the average score.

7. Enhancements
You could improve the program by:

Validating inputs (e.g., ensuring grades are within a valid range like 0-100).
Allowing the teacher to input names for each student, which would let you print a detailed report.
